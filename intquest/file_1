Python allows you to open files in one of the three modes. They are:
read-only mode, write-only mode, read-write mode, and append mode by specifying the flags “r”, “w”, “rw”, “a” respectively.
A text file can be opened in any one of the above said modes by specifying the option “t” along with
“r”, “w”, “rw”, and “a”, so that the preceding modes become “rt”, “wt”, “rwt”, and “at”.A binary file can be opened
in any one of the above said modes by specifying the option “b” along with “r”, “w”, “rw”, and “a” so that the
preceding modes become “rb”, “wb”, “rwb”, “ab”.
